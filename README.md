### Producing

In a few years it is necessary to pass the way of mastering the full cycle of production. From mining of minerals and energy, processing and production of chemicals, to production of microelectronics and telecommunication networks. What took the whole world **80 years** should be accomplish in a few years.

### Chip

For **[artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)**, it is necessary to produce **[2 nm process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_nm_process)** chips in which the main function will be to support **[neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning))**. One chip will combine **[CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)** · **[GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)** · **[RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)** · **[SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)** · **[Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_chip)** · **[100 Gbit Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Gigabit_Ethernet)** · **[WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)** · **[Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)** · **[Cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network)**.

**∞1 000 000 000** is needed to set up production (∞1 void = $1).

### Farm

Another area of **V O I D tech** is the autonomous cultivation of plants and living beings. It can be deployed at home, creating small **year-round farms**. Autonomous watering, lighting, humidification, temperature control, blowing. Also feeding and cleaning of animals.

<img src="https://github.com/voidspawner/void.ideology/blob/main/site/image/farm.webp" width="100%">

Up to giant **vertical spiral farms** that can go **1 000 km** below the surface, and can be used on different planets, with different gravity, pressure and radiation. For example, the diameter of **[Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon))**, a satellite of **[Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter)**, is only **3 121 km**. Providing food for **10 quadrillion people** on the planet (10 000 000 000 000 000). **1 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

Filling the entire space from the **Earth** to **Moon** (which is half the radius of the **Sun**), the population could reach **5 sextillion people** (5 000 000 000 000 000 000 000). **500 000 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

Filling the entire space from the **Earth** to **Mars** and from the **Earth** to **Venus**, the population could reach **15 octillion people** (15 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000). **1 500 000 000 000 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

### Spawner

Autonomous **shape-shifting** devices controlled by **V O I D ai**, traveling from one star system to another to **populate planets** with humans and other living beings. Each repopulated planet creates new spawners. Increasing their numbers **exponentially**.

> **Elipse** · Lifting off the planet's surface
> 
> **Sphere** · Landing on the planet's surface
> 
> **Dome** · Standing on the planet's surface

<img src="https://github.com/voidspawner/void.ideology/blob/main/site/image/spawner-shape.webp" width="100%">

Spawners signal each other that a planet has been populated to prevent repopulation. And also exchange data about the location of other spawners, a **map of the Universe** and accumulated **knowledge** from other star systems.

Autonomous **underground factories** persist on the planet. Goods are crafted **individually** to meet people's needs and delivered autonomously.

## V O I D game
**[⌜ V O I D game ⌟](https://voidsp.ru/game)** is a game that creates an **infinite** number of games, vapps and content.

## V O I D social
**[⌜ V O I D social ⌟](https://voidsp.ru/social)** is a social network where you can **quickly** and **easily** communicate without words with people all over the world.

## V O I D lang
**[⌜ V O I D lang ⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.lang)** is the language for rapidly creating applications in the **[V O I D](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.lang#v-o-i-d-format)** or **[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)** format. It is used as a replacement for both the standard Bash/CMD/etc. languages and for writing **UI Applications**, **Servers** and **Games**. The language uses one of the languages already preinstalled in the system. So you don't need to install anything else. Code and data are not separated. So the whole application fits in **one V O I D or JSON file**. Since the **code is presented as data**, applications can be easily generated with **AI**, updated, installed and launched remotely.

## V O I D os
**[⌜ V O I D os ⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.os)** is an Operating System that uses **V O I D lang** to run and create applications and games.

## V O I D ideology
**[⌜ V O I D ⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.ideology)**  is not only about compact technologies, but also an **ideology** that shows where these technologies are taking us.

## V O I D license
**⌜ V O I D license ⌟** is a license to distribute digital content and goods. Expressed in a single sentence:

> **DO WHAT YOU WANT**

You can use it in both **private** and **open source**, embed it in **free** or **paid** products. **Modify**. Create your **own solutions** based on it. **No need to specify the author**.

## V O I D task
> [!IMPORTANT]
> By adding your code to the repository, you are publishing it under the **V O I D licence**.
