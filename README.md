# V O I D tech

## About

**⌜ V O I D tech ⌟** is combinable devices controlled by **[V O I D ai](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.lang)** to perform **home**, **business**, **industrial** purposes and **teaching children** to interact with technology.

## Combining

The idea is based on **combining** different elements of tech, so that it can be quickly repurposed for the desired type of work in different working directions. For example, combine **manipulators** to get a vertically and horizontally walking drone. Add **wheels** so that the drone can not only walk, but also drive on the surface. Add **propellers** so that additionally can fly over obstacles. This type of drone can be used in **delivery**, **construction**, **patrolling**, in the **warehouse**, **production**, to **carry goods** from the store or car, even as a **vehicle**.

Similarly with computer equipment. A laptop can be disassembled into its component parts.

> **Screen** ・ tablet
>
> **Touchpad** ・ smartphone / mouse
>
> **Keyboard** ・ a computing base that can work autonomously as a server
>
> **Power supply** ・ wireless charging for smartphone and headphones

The same applies to other tech that can be used in different ways.

> **Music speaker** (pill) ・ swivel mechanism / smartphone charging, stacking speakers on top of each other to increase sound volume, spreading across a room for spatial sound, home control
>
> **Dust collector** and **cleaning mechanism** ・ cleaning the room and work surface
>
> **Opening containers** ・ remotely open and close containers, cool or heat contents, mount on drone for delivery, securely install servers
>
> **Lock** ・ remote opening and closing
>
> **Lamp** ・ remote switching on and off, brightness and color adjustment
>
> **Power strip** ・ customize turning devices on and off
>
> **Battery** ・ provide power, combine with power strip to create an uninterruptible power supply
>
> **External camera** ・ monitor the territory
>
> **Manipulator** ・ carrying objects, remote control

All this can be mounted on the **drone**. Separately can be mounted various **sensors** for night vision, humidity, smoke, temperature, weight, medical sensors and other.

The tech is developed taking into account both use on Earth and in airless space, outer space.

## Farm

Another area of **V O I D tech** is the autonomous cultivation of plants and living beings. It can be deployed at home, creating small **year-round farms**. Up to giant **vertical spiral farms** that can go **1 000 km** below the surface, and can be used on different planets, with different gravity, pressure and radiation. Providing food for **10 quadrillion people** on the planet (10 000 000 000 000 000). **1 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

Filling the entire space from the **Earth** to **Moon** (which is half the radius of the Sun), the population could reach **5 sextillion people** (5 000 000 000 000 000 000 000). **500 000 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

Filling the entire space from the **Earth** to **Mars** and from the **Earth** to **Venus**, the population could reach **15 octillion people** (15 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000). **1 500 000 000 000 000 000 times the current population of the Earth**.

## Spawner

Autonomous **shape-shifting** devices controlled by **V O I D ai**, traveling from one star system to another to **populate planets** with humans and other living beings. Each repopulated planet creates new spawners. Increasing their numbers **exponentially**.

> **Elongated** cylinder shape tapered at the ends · Lifting off the planet's surface
> 
> **Sphere** · Landing on the planet's surface
> 
> **Dome** · Standing on the planet's surface

Spawners signal each other that a planet has been populated to prevent repopulation. And also exchange data about the location of other spawners, a **map of the Universe** and accumulated **knowledge** from other star systems.

Autonomous **underground factories** persist on the planet. Goods are crafted **individually** to meet people's needs and delivered autonomously.

## V O I D license
**⌜ V O I D license ⌟** is a license to distribute digital content and goods. Expressed in a single sentence:

> **DO WHAT YOU WANT**

You can use it in both **private** and **open source**, embed it in **free** or **paid** products. **Modify**. Create your **own solutions** based on it. **No need to specify the author**.

## V O I D lang
**[⌜ V O I D lang ⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.lang)** is the language for rapidly creating applications in the **[V O I D](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.lang#v-o-i-d-format)** or **[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)** format. It is used as a replacement for both the standard Bash/CMD/etc. languages and for writing **UI Applications**, **Servers** and **Games**. The language uses one of the languages already preinstalled in the system. So you don't need to install anything else. Code and data are not separated. So the whole application fits in **one V O I D or JSON file**. Since the **code is presented as data**, applications can be easily generated with **AI**, updated, installed and launched remotely.

## V O I D os
**[⌜ V O I D os ⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.os)** is an Operating System that uses **V O I D lang** to run and create applications and games.

## V O I D ideology
**[⌜V O I D⌟](https://github.com/voidspawner/void.ideology)**  is not only about compact technologies, but also an **ideology** that shows where these technologies are taking us.
